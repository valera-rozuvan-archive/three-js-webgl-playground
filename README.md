Quickly get going with developing a Three.js WebGL application using TypeScript & WebPack.

## Live version

See a live preview of this project hosted via GitHub pages:
[https://valera-rozuvan.github.io/three-js-webgl-playground](https://valera-rozuvan.github.io/three-js-webgl-playground).

## Running & Building

To start hacking:

```
git clone https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/three-js-webgl-playground
cd ./three-js-webgl-playground
npm install
npm run start
```

This will get you a development server up and running with livereload capability.
Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` and observe a spinning cube.

To generate static files:

```
npm run build
```

This will produce a `./dist` folder with `html`, `js`, and `css` files.
